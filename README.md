Python Programming Assignments

This repository contains solutions to various Python programming exercises, demonstrating fundamental concepts such as control flow, functions, random number generation, and basic arithmetic operations.

 File Description

assignment1.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and logic for the exercises listed below.

 Exercises Covered

1. Prime Number Checker

Objective: Write a program to check if a given number is prime.

Logic:

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The function iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number to check for divisibility.

Returns True if the number is prime, otherwise False.

2. Product of Random Numbers

Objective: Generate two random numbers and calculate their product.

Logic:

Uses Python's random module to generate numbers.

Computes the product and displays the result.

Useful for simulations or simple randomized testing.

3. Hospital Billing System

Objective: Calculate the final bill for a hospital patient based on their stay, lab tests, and medication costs.

Features:

Room Charges: Calculated based on the number of days stayed (e.g., ₹2000/day).

Doctor Consultation: A fixed fee (e.g., ₹1500).

Lab Charges: Calculated based on the number of tests taken.

Medicine Cost: Added directly to the bill.

Discounts: Applies a discount (e.g., 10%) if the total bill exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., ₹10,000).

Output: displays a detailed billing summary including all charges, the subtotal, applicable discount, and the final payable amount.
